# Sound Effects

This directory contains sound effects for the terminal portfolio:

1. `click.mp3` - Used for UI interactions (buttons, menus)
2. `toggle.mp3` - Used for toggle actions like the wobble effect

You should add your own sound files here in MP3 format with names matching those listed above.

For best user experience:
- Keep sound effects short (< 0.5 seconds)
- Use subtle sounds that aren't distracting
- Keep volume levels low as they'll play during interaction
